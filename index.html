<p>Cloud Computing has the potential to enhance agility and productivity while enabling economic and efficiency benefits to organizations of all sizes. It is also an enabler for Big Data analytics providing valuable insights, and advantages for them.</p>
<p>The paradigm shift in IT service delivery model in Internet raises cloud and big data security and privacy concerns. Concerns about privacy and control over data are major impediments to the growth of cloud and its wide adoption.</p>
<p>In this article we provide a overview of the requirement and challenges in a privacy aware access control in clouds, provide an overview of currently used access controls methods in terms of privacy, and introduce attribute based access control as a privacy preservation methodology and different challenges and applications the should be considered for implementation of future cloud access controls.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud services know too much about their customers</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In most countries and in most industries data privacy regulations apply whenever personally identifiable information (PII) is collected and stored. Organizations are moving their information systems to cloud and there seems to be no area of ICT that is not affected by cloud computing. Governments, public sector, private sector and many industries including financial services, retail, healthcare, transportation, education, and communication depend on personal information to provide services and conduct business operations, serve customers, and process payments and receipts.</p>
<p>Organizations as a provider or consumer of cloud services are being required to enforce access control and privacy restrictions to meet regulatory requirements and privacy protection laws that regulate collection, holding, use and disclosure of personal information. Organizations that have not properly controlled access to their data sets are facing lawsuits, negative publicity, and regulatory fines.</p>
<p>Current access control solutions in untrusted clouds mainly focus on protecting confidentiality of data from unauthorized access and the storage provider. A major challenge is achieving confidentiality while preserving privacy of authorized users and sharing data and PII selectively based on the specified access control policies.</p>
<p><strong>What is the state of cloud access controls in terms of privacy?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Traditional identity based access control models including Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Discretionary Access Control (DAC), and Role Based Access Control (RBAC) make an implicit assumption that the entity enforcing access control policies are also the owner of data. However, this in not true in an untrusted cloud computing environment. Hence, the data should be stored in the encrypted form and access control is performed over the encrypted data.&nbsp;Encryption is a commonly adopted approach to assure data confidentiality. However, It is not sufficient because organizations often have also to enforce access control on the data.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the trust chain used by traditional access control methods. Access control lists (ACL) are established by the object owner or administrator and access to the object is through addition of user to an ACL.</p>
<p><figure class="clear"><img src="./acl-trust.jpg" alt="acl-trust" width="600" height=""></figure></p>
<p>Figure 1: ACL Trust chain (Source: NIST Special Publication 800-162, Guide to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC), p 21)</p>
<p>With the involvement of the third-party cloud services, a crucial issue is that the identity attributes in the access control policies may reveal privacy-sensitive information about users and organizations and leak confidential information about the content. The confidentiality of the content and the privacy of the users are thus not assured if the identity attributes are not protected.</p>
<p>It is well known that privacy, both individual as well as organizational, is considered a key requirement in all solutions, including cloud services, for digital identity management. The state of the research and development in this field shows that privacy issues are still unsolved and a major concern in cloud computing. An important requirement is to support fine-grained access control, based on policies specified using identity attributes, over encrypted data.</p>
<p><strong>Attribute based access control approach in privacy control.</strong></p>
<p>The most important model in cloud is attribute based access control (ABAC) and has proven to be capable of enforcing MAC, DAC and RBAC policies and provide flexibility requirements for cloud computing. This control is often based on security-relevant properties of users, referred to as identity attributes. These access control systems are referred to as attribute based access control (ABAC) systems. Fine-grained access control is one of the major provisions of attribute based access control (ABAC) in the cloud services.</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows the&nbsp;trust relationship in ABAC systems. the root of the trust is derived from many sources that provide attributes and policies. There are more complex trust relationships required in this method to work properly but more flexibility and context awareness is provided.</p>
<p><figure class="clear"><img src="./abac-trust.jpg" alt="abac-trust" width="600" height=""></figure></p>
<p>Figure 2: ABAC trust chain (Source: NIST Special Publication 800-162, Guide to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC), p 22)</p>
<p>Access to cloud resources are protected based on ownership of a specific attribute. This not only includes user credentials as in Role based access control approach but also includes other data such as location, time of access, and different attributes that can be assigned to a profile. In another words, ABAC combines many attributes to make a decision based on the context of the request for access, this context is not just based on the role of a user.</p>
<p>Multiple privacy contexts can be defined in this approach such as restriction on access to personal data , minimization of the amount of the personal data that is required for provisioning a service, in this scenario the data that may be useful for other future usage is not provided, and finally the use of data is limited to a specific purpose that the data has been gathered or stored for, in this scenario the data usage is restricted to specific purposes and any other use needs data owner consent to be received as an extra attribute.</p>
<p>Using ABAC in privacy preservation and access control in the clouds have some practical advantages too. In this approach all access decisions are centrally managed based on policies defined and managed centrally in the organization managers and access usage policies rather than IT administrators. Attribute based approach also simplifies software development because a flexible policy enforcement module can be defined as an abstract external module that is called in the access decision making time. This also creates another benefit that changes in all access rules are immediately updated when different attributes are changed and no extra administration of access rules is required.</p>
<p><strong>What are the challenges of privacy preservation?</strong></p>
<p>Preserving privacy and data confidentiality in cloud access control systems is a challenging and open issue. There is an increasing demand to enforce access control in a cloud computing environment without sacrificing data privacy and exposing identity information.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;sustainable access control and decision system that addresses privacy issues and considers cloud computing core security and access control requirements should address multiple domains including data confidentiality and integrity, access control, scalability and user accountability.</p>
<p>The are research challenges and long time objectives that try to address these issues in different applications, to name a few these include the general cloud computing services to privacy preservation requirements in data analytics systems, compliance with regulations, and selective disclosure and sharing of information without including identifiable data.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Privacy preservation in the new era of cloud computing has become a concern for people, organizations and governments. Cloud providers and companies care about the compliance with regulations and want to avoid lawsuits.</p>
<p>Cloud end users and privacy advocacy groups also want to know about the privacy and data confidentiality protection mechanisms available in cloud computing paradigm.</p>
<p>The future of cloud services must address the challenging issues around privacy concerns and it has become just as important as security and confidentiality of information. A modern approach to implement context-aware privacy preserving access controls is achieved by shifting the access model from traditional systems to attribute based access control (ABAC) model. It allows a considerable amount of flexibility and security while preserving privacy and also compatibility with traditional approaches such as role based access control.</p>
